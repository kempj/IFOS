# What is IFOS2D?

**IFOS2D** (**I**nversion of **F**ull **O**bserved **S**eismograms) is a 2-D elastic full waveform inversion code.  
The inversion problem is solved by a conjugate gradient method and the gradients are computed in the time domain by the adjoint state method.  
The forward modeling is done by a time domain Finite-Difference scheme. 

IFOS2D is the reverse (inverse) of our 2-D Finite-Difference forward solver [**SOFI2D**](https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/SOFI2D).
